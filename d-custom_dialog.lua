haven't seen you since\
the great king's royal\
match!\
\
\
I'm sure you can tell,\
but things are a little\
crazy around here\
right now...\
\
\
Looks like you're trying\
to sort this all out!\
\
\
\
\
Here's a word of advice,\
I scouted ahead into\
the cave over there\
and it seems pretty\
challenging.\
\
That cutter ability of\
yours is helpful, but\
it won't be enough to\
collect any star power\
down there.\
\
You might notice this\
at other points in your\
adventure too.\
\
\
\
I'm sure certain areas\
won't be passable without\
some extra abilities...\
\
\
\
Don't worry though, these\
dimensions colliding did\
have a silver lining!\
\
\
\
If you begin to see any\
signs that you might not\
have the necessary ability\
to pass a trial, you're\
bound to be able to find\
it in a different world!\
Good luck, Mario!\
I believe in you!"))

This is the New N-Sanity\

It seems that the\

got fused with parts of\
the Tiny Huge Island.\
I guess it's not bad\
how it turned out...\
Except for those annoying\
giant goombas.\
Well you better move on\
now, 8 more stars are\
waiting for you!"))
